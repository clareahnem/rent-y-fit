        <h1>What is RENT-Y-FiT?</h1>
        <p>We've all been in the situation where we have so many clothes we want to buy, but we can't afford it. It also seems too much of a waste to buy such an expensive designer, only to wear it a few times. </p>
        <p>Wouldn't it be great if we could just borrow a clothing item for a few days or weeks and avoid paying the full price for it?</p>
        <p>Or, do you have items that are just sitting in your closet without being used?</p> 
        <p>RENT-Y-FiT creates an alternative solution to buying streetwear clothings and accessories for every season</p>
        <p>It is a platform where we can rent other people's awesome clothes, and at the same time make some pocket money yourself by renting out some items in your closet!</p>
        <p>It's a win-win situation for everyone to enjoy fashion while producing less waste and supporting each other in the community!</p>
